# Gauge Panel

Gauge panel project for my final year project of my Computer Science course on
Middlesex University London.

My final year project consists of developing a service polling data from flight
simulator engine and distributing it to the frontend app that animates the UI.

My supervisor is [Igor Topolski](https://github.com/itopolskiMDX).

## Installation
To install and run this project, simply run following commands:

`npm i`

`npm start`

The application with gauges in their default position will start. The background
script has booted listener. By default, the comminication is done via `websockets`.
You can select one of following listeners:

`npm run start:ws`

`npm run start:udc`
